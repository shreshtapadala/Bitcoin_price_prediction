TIME SERIES ANALYSIS FOR PUBLIC DECENTRALIZED LEDGER PRICE PREDICTION WITH EDA

A "public decentralized ledger" generally refers to a blockchain, which is a distributed and immutable digital ledger that records transactions across a network of computers in a secure and transparent manner. Blockchain technology underpins cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and it is also being explored for various other applications beyond cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin stands out as the most valuable cryptocurrency globally, being traded on numerous exchanges and accepted in various currencies.

While traditional financial markets have been extensively studied for prediction purposes, Bitcoin offers a unique challenge due to its status as a time series prediction problem within a rapidly evolving market.

Given its unique characteristics, traditional methods struggle to provide accurate predictions. As a result, machine learning emerges as a promising solution due to its proven performance in similar domains. Therefore, this work utilizes time series analysis to identify patterns in Bitcoin's price movement and forecast closing prices for the upcoming days, employing the ARIMA model for this purpose.

By applying machine learning techniques to the analysis of financial data, we hope to gain valuable insights into the future of Bitcoin prices, which can have both direct and indirect effects on the global economy.
